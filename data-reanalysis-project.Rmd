## Elements of Your Report:

You should start your reanalysis report with a short description of the study and of the specific data and reanalyses you will be doing, to orient your reader. Outline (briefly) the goal of the original paper, the data set used, and the analyses conducted, then describe which ones you will replicate. You should also demonstrate how you read in your datafile and show a few lines of raw data in your output (e.g., using `head()`).

I will be looking for you to clearly take your reader through all of the elements of data manipulation, analysis, and, if appropriate, visualization. You should provide as much coding detail, explanation, and output tables as necessary to compare your results to those published!

#Titi monkey call sequences vary with predator location and type 
### - by Cäsar, C., Zuberbühler, K., Young, R. J., & Byrne, R. W. [(2013)](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/5/20130535.short). 



This paper investigates the alarm calls of the [black-fronted titi monkey](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Callicebus_nigrifrons_Minas_Gerais.jpg). These small Neotropical primates are known to be hunted by a variety of animals, such as raptors, terrestrial carnovires, and snakes. In a previous study, which you can find [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-011-1313-0), Cäsar et al. established that the titis use two main alarm calls upon encountering predators. Alarm call type A is used upon encountering raptors whereas call type B is used when terrestrial predators are spotted. Only rarely is call type C heard, and the authors are not sure of wen it is used. 

Some data in this previous study seemed to show that maybe these A and B calls were not only predator-specific, but potentially reveal the predator's location. In this study the authors explore this hypothesis by presenting the titi monkeys with two different predator types (oncilla vs. caracara) and elevations (terrestrial vs. aerial). (Even though caracaras do not seem likely predators, [suspected predation of an infant howler monkey](http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/1200343/18198280/1337026355110/NP161_C.+plancus+and+A.+palliata_McKinney.pdf?token=lFo5i82vIBGBUSam1b76rBWjCYA%3D) has been reported.) 

The authors recorded the type of the first 30 calls uttered upon ecountering the oncilla or caracara models, the latency between calls, the duration of the alarm calling, and number of alarm calls per individual, and more (see datasets 'data1', 'data2', 'data3'.

The authors also recorded and uploaded the vocal response of the titi monkeys in reponse to each of the four testin conditions: ["Raptor on the ground"](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/suppl/2013/08/29/rsbl.2013.0535.DC1/Raptor_on_the_ground_first_part.wav), ["Oncilla on the ground"](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/suppl/2013/08/29/rsbl.2013.0535.DC1/Cat_on_the_ground.wav), ["Raptor in the canopy"](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/suppl/2013/08/29/rsbl.2013.0535.DC1/Raptor_in_the_canopy.wav), ["Oncilla in the canopy"](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/suppl/2013/08/29/rsbl.2013.0535.DC1/Cat_in_the_canopy.wav).

What I'll do next is take you through their results, step by step explaining how they analyzed their data - and why - and what the results from these analyses are.



##Loading the datasets!

First, I'll load in all of the datasets that I will be using throughout my re-analysis. The original file was one Excel file with three sheets of data, here separated into three .csv files. The head(data#) code will show you the first section of these datasets. You can compare them to the original dataset, which you can find in my GitHub repository.
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Callicebus/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/CallType.csv")
data1 <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.strings=c("","NA"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(data1)

f2 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Callicebus/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/CallInterval.csv")
data2 <- read.csv(f2, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(data2)

f3 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Callicebus/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/General.csv")
data3 <- read.csv(f3, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(data3)
```



##Pie charts - What call types do the titis use?
I'll start by replicating the pie charts in Figure 1 of the article. In dataset 'data1' the authors recorded the call type (call A, B, C or silence) of the first thirty calls in response to the titis encountering the caracara or oncilla models. They then used these data to vizualise the monkeys' responses in pie charts. Even though I think bar charts are a better way of representing these data, I'll stick to pie charts because I haven't learned how to make those yet.
The authors split their data up in ine pie chart for the first call, one pie chart for calls 2-4, one pie chart for calls 5-15, and one pie chart for calls 16-30. It is not explained exactly why they chose these clusters.

```{r}
# Step 1: I will pull the subsets of data from 'data1' that I need for creating each individual pie charts. 'rc' will stand for Raptor in Canopy, 'rg' for Raptor on Ground, 'oc' for Oncilla in Canopy, 'og' for Oncilla on Ground.

# I'd like to get all 16 pie charts in a row, like in Figure 1 of the article. To do so, I'll first use the plot_grid() command, which lets you organize your graphs and add labels to them.
totalplot <- plot_grid(pie.rc1, pie.rc2, pie.rc3, pie.rc4, pie.rg1, pie.rg2, pie.rg3, pie.rg4, pie.og1, pie.og2, pie.og3, pie.og4, pie.oc1, pie.oc2, pie.oc3, pie.oc4, labels=c("Raptor Canopy", " ", " ", " ", "Raptor Ground", " ", " ", " ", "Oncilla Ground", " ", " ", " ", "Oncilla Canopy", " "," "," ", ncol = 4, nrow = 4), label_size = 10, hjust = -0.5, vjust = 10.5)

# grid.arrange() is a cool little code! It lets you arrange graphs within a table-like structure, so that you can use it to place the legend (which we saved in 'legend' earlier) just once underneath all your pie charts rather than with each individual chart! Less clutter!
grid.arrange(totalplot, legend, nrow = 2, heights = c(30, 2))
```

If I'd had more time (i.e. started this assignment earlier...) I would have liked to find out how I can make sure the graph title on the top 4 pie charts doesn't affect the size of the charts (they are currently slightly smaller than the rest due to title placement). 
For comparison below you'll see Figure 1 as published in the article. The charts produces with the code above seem to be pretty accurate when compared to Figure 1 in the article.

##G-test - observed vs. expected call sequence frequencies

Next, the authors used a G-test to find out if the observed call sequences are different from the expected call frequencies. In the article the authors sugges that they use Table S2, a contingency table, to conduct these G-tests.

<img src="img/TableS2.png" width="750px"/>

A G-test in R can be done through the GTest() function, which is part of the DescTools package. An exampe is below, using data from Table S2: 

```{r}
library(DescTools)
observed <- c(5, 1, 3) # Observed frequencies
expected <- c(rep(1/3, 3)) # Expected proportions

GTest(x=observed, p=expected, correct="williams")
```

One can also do this without the DescTools package by using the following code:
```{r}
observed <- c(5, 1, 3)
expected <- c(rep(1/3, 3))

degrees <- 2 # Degrees of freedom
expected.count <- sum(observed)*expected
G <- 2 * sum(observed * log(observed / expected.count)) # Calculting G-value
G                          
pchisq(G, df=degrees, lower.tail=FALSE) # Using that G-value to get to th p-value.
```

As you can see from these results, the first method is probably the one that ws used by the authors (that is, if they used R at all) as it was a Williams G-test, the second version is a general G-test and not a Williams G-test, and thus has slightly different G- and _p_-values.
Either way, no matter what combinations of data I use from Tabel S2, I cannot replicate any of the results in their paper. The numbers I used above are the observed vs. expected frequencies of call sequences for the 'Raptor on Ground' condition. Their results for this test are as follows:
G = 6.2639, d.f. = 2, and _p_ = 0.0436.
Quite disappointing, but let's move on to the next section!



##Histograms of call duration and rate vs. nature of threat

Next, in their Figure 2 the authors create histograms to show (a) the median duration of the calls in minutes for all four testing conditions and (b) the median number of calls per individual for all four conditions. I figured out how to make the standard histograms, which show you mean rather than median, but cannot seem to find out how to make it represent a line for median rather than mean. Nonetheless, the results in my representation are (nearly?) identical to those in Figure 2.

```{r}
# This first snippet of code makes R follow the order in which the 4 test conditions appear in the dataset. Without this code, my boxplots were ordered alphabetically, and thus organized exactly opposite of what was shown in Figure 2.
data3$Stimulus = factor(data3$Stimulus, unique(data3$Stimulus)) 

# I only selected rows 1 to 20 because the last 2 rows of data were invalid records, and thus need to be kept out of the analysis.
boxplot <- ggplot(data3[1:20,], aes(Stimulus, Dur.MIN)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(text = element_text(size=10), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=0), panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white'), axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", size = 0.5), axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", size = 0.5), legend.position = "none", axis.title.x=element_blank()) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,120,20)) + labs(y = "duration (min)")

boxplot2 <- ggplot(data3[1:20,], aes(Stimulus, calls.ind)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(text = element_text(size=10), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=0), panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white'), axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", size = 0.5), axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", size = 0.5)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,60,10)) + labs(y = "no. calls per individual")

# Again by using plot_grid() you can organize your graphs in such a way that they nearly perfectly compare to those in Figure 2. I just cannot find out how to change their height in plot_grid()!
plot_grid(boxplot, boxplot2, labels=c("(a)", "(b)"), ncol = 1, nrow = 2, label_size = 12)
```

Figure 2 as in the article, for comparison:

<img src="img/figure2.png" width="700px"/>

When looking at these histograms it becomes apparent that titis respond very different to encountering an oncilla than to encountering a caracara. Both duration and the number of calls per individual are much higher when an oncilla is encountered than when a caracara is encountered. What this means depends on the behavior of the primates once they stop vocalizing in case of the caracara. Do they resume daily business, or do they keep quiet and hide? In the first case it could suggest that titis don't feel as threatened by the presence of a caracara when compared to the presence of an oncilla. Strangely enough, the authors do not mention these results in their discussion at all. I felt at the least they should have discussed if and why the caracara is or is not a good predator model in this study.


##Friedman Tests - Do duration and # of alarm calls vary with the nature of the threat?

To confirm the histogram results with statistics, the auhors conducted Friedman tests.
First, this is the Friedman test for differences in duration of the calls between the four conditions. 
```{r}
# Cutting the two invalid datapoints from dataset:
data3.1 <- data3[-c(21:23), ] 

# Friedman Test does not work if you don't change your group and block variables into factors. 
data3.1$Stimulus <- factor(data3.1$Stimulus) 
data3.1$Group <- factor(data3.1$Group)

# Friedman test:
friedman.test(data3.1$Dur.MIN ~ Stimulus|Group, data3.1) 
```

This first Friedman Test gets me the same _X_ <sup>2</sup> value of 12.120 as in the paper, but my _p_-value of 0.006 is different than their _p_-value of 0.001. I'm not sure why, as the previous histograms of the same data and _X_ <sup>2</sup>-values do match up.

Secondly, a Friedman test for the differences in number of calls per individual in the four conditions.
```{r}
friedman.test(data3.1$calls.ind ~ Stimulus|Group, data3.1)

```

Here the same issue returns: all data match up except for the _p_-value. Not really sure why.



##Wilcoxon Tests

To determine if these differences we saw in the histograms and Friedmans tests between raptors and oncillas are signifcant, the authors conducted a Wilcoxon test.

```{r}

wilcox.test(data3.1$Dur.MIN[11:20] - data3.1$Dur.MIN[1:10], alternative = "two.sided")
wilcox.test(data3.1$calls.ind[11:20] - data3.1$calls.ind[1:10], alternative = "two.sided")

```

The results are equal for call duration and rate of calling. I get a V of 55, which is the same as te _z_-score of 55 reported in the paper. In both my analysis and that in the paper _n_ = 10, but the _p_-value mentioned in the article is 0.006, whereas mine is _p_ = 0.002. Either way, the results show that there is a significant difference in both call duration and rate between titis encountering an oncilla or caracara. Both calling duration and rate are lower for encountering caracaras.

Last, the authors conducted Wilcoxon tests to assess any difference in the time between the first and second call when titis are faced with with a raptor on the ground vs in the canopy, and when titis encounter an oncilla on the ground or in the canopy.
```{r}
# First you'll need to install and/or load the package 'Coin' to run wilcoxsign_test(), because this time we want an exact test  and wilcox.test() does not offer that option.
library(coin) 

mdata2 <- t(data2) # First I want to transpose these data 'data2' so that they are easier for me to work with.

# Wilcoxon Exact test for 'Raptor in Canopy' versus 'Raptor on Ground'.
rc.int <- as.numeric(c(mdata2[2:6, 2])) # Now I select only the call interval times for 'Raptor in Canopy'.
rg.int <- as.numeric(c(mdata2[9:13, 2])) # Select call interval times for 'Raptor on Ground'.
wilcoxsign_test(rc.int ~ rg.int, distribution = "exact")

# Wilcoxon Exact test for 'Oncilla in Canopy' versus 'Oncilla on Ground'.
og.int <- as.numeric(c(mdata2[16:20, 2]))
oc.int <- as.numeric(c(mdata2[23:27, 2]))
wilcoxsign_test(oc.int ~ og.int, distribution = "exact")

```

The resuls of both these tests match with those presented in the paper. I get a _z_-value of -2.023 and an exac _p_-value of 0.063.

The authors also present these data in a graph in Figure S3 in the supplementary data.
```{r}

# The 'myPalette' code below makes sure that Type A calls are always colored black, Type B calls always dark grey, etc.
myPalette2 <- c("A" = "black","D" = "yellow","GM" = "green", "GP" = "blue", "GR" = "pink") 

# The next 4 lines create a dataframe that I can use to recreate Figure S3.
raptor <- c(rep("Raptor Canopy", 5), rep("Raptor Ground", 5)) 
raptor.int <- c(rc.int, rg.int)
group1 <- as.character(c(mdata2[2:6, 1]))
df1 <- data.frame(raptor, group1, raptor.int)

# Now that I have all data I need in 1 dataframe, I can create the graph:
plot1 <- ggplot(df1,aes(x = raptor,y = raptor.int,color = group1, group = group1)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 3) + labs(y = "Interval 1st/2nd call (s)") + theme(text = element_text(size=10), legend.position = "none") + scale_fill_manual(values = myPalette2)


# Then I'll do the same for the Oncilla data:
oncilla <- c(rep("Oncilla Canopy", 5), rep("Oncilla Ground", 5)) 
oncilla.int <- c(oc.int, og.int)
oncilla.int <- log(oncilla.int) # Authors took logarithm of the interval data.

group1 <- as.character(c(mdata2[2:6, 1]))
df2 <- data.frame(oncilla, group1, oncilla.int)
plot2 <- ggplot(df2,aes(x = oncilla,y = oncilla.int,color = group1, group = group1)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 3) + labs(y = "Interval 1st/2nd call (log s)") + theme(text = element_text(size=10)) + scale_fill_manual(values = myPalette2)


plot_grid(plot1, plot2, labels=c("(a)", "(b)"), ncol = 1, nrow = 2, label_size = 12)
```

As you can see in comparison Figure S3 from the supplementary material, my graphs have turned out the same, except for that Oncilla Ground and Oncilla Canopy have been reversed in positions in my second graph. I had used a code to try to fix that (the one that worked in an earlier section of this report), but it wouldn't work this time. Anyhow, these graphs also show that
